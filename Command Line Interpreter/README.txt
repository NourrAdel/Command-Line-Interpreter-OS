Command Line Interpreter (CLI) 

Overview:
The Command Line Interpreter (CLI) functions as a basic shell for your operating system. The CLI will interact with the user through the keyboard, interpreting and executing commands entered by the user. 
The program will continue to accept and process commands until the user inputs "exit," which will terminate the CLI.

Commands:
You Can Use a total of 12 commands from this list:

- `echo <argument>`: Prints the given argument.
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
- `cd [<path>]`: Changes the current directory to the specified path, the home directory if no argument is given, or the previous directory if `..` is specified.
- `ls`: Lists the contents of the current directory alphabetically.
- `ls -r`: Lists the contents of the current directory in reverse order.
- `mkdir <directory>`: Creates one or more directories.
- `rmdir <directory>`: Removes an empty directory or all empty directories if `*` is specified.
- `touch <file>`: Creates a file at the specified path.
- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copies a file from source to destination.
- `rm <file>`: Removes a specified file.
- `cat <file>`: Prints the contents of a file or concatenates and prints the contents of two files.
- `history`: Displays a list of previously entered commands.

Additional Note:
- **Exit Command**: Use the `exit` command to terminate the CLI.
